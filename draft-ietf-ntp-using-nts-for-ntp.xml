      <t>This memo specifies Network Time Security (NTS) measures with which
      to protect the Network Time Protocol (NTP). This includes mechanisms for
      using TLS for key exchange, in combination with Message Authentication
      Codes (MACs) in extension fields to protect client-server mode time
      synchronization packets as well as mechanisms to directly apply Datagram
      TLS to provide cryptographic security for NTP packets.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document provides detail on what measures to use specifically to
      secure time synchronization between NTP participants. In particular, it
      describes two main techniques. The first is a mechanism that uses TLS
      (over a connection on TCP port 123) to exchange key data and that
      afterwards allows to secure NTP mode 3 and 4 packets using Message
      Authentication Codes embedded in extension fields of those packets. The
      second is a mechanism for using <xref target="RFC6347">Datagram
      Transport Layer Security</xref> (DTLS) to provide cryptographic security
      for NTP mode 1, 2 and 6 packets.</t>

      <t>While the detailed application described in this document is
      inherently NTP-specific, the overall approach is not. Therefore, it
      could be taken as guidance on how future work may apply the described
      techniques to other time synchronization protocols (such as the <xref
      target="IEC.61588_2009">Precision Time Protocol</xref>).</t>

    <section title="Objectives">
      <t>The specific objectives for the measures described this document are
      as follows:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Protection for NTP time synchronization messages:<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>Integrity: NTS protects the integrity of NTP time
              synchronization protocol packets via a MAC.</t>

              <t>Confidentiality: NTS does not generally provide
              confidentiality protection of the time synchronization data. It
              does so only in the case of NTP's symmetric/peer mode.</t>

              <t>Privacy: NTS preserves unlinkability, i. e. it does not leak
              data that would allow a passive attacker to track mobile NTP
              clients when they move between networks. Note that unlinkability
              is not guaranteed in the presence of active attackers, see <xref
              target="privacy_considerations_unlinkability"/>.</t>

              <t>Request-Response-Consistency: NTS enables a client to match
              an incoming response to a request it has sent. NTS also enables
              the client to deduce from the response whether its request to
              the server has arrived without alteration. This is to prevent
              attacks employing replays of valid server responses.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Additional protection for key exchange messages:<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>Authenticity: NTS enables an NTP client to authenticate its
              time server(s) during key exchange procedures.</t>

              <t>Authorization: NTS optionally enables the server to verify
              the client's authorization.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Modes of operation: Both the client-server mode and the symmetric
          peer mode of NTP are supported. The broadcast mode of NTP can NOT be
          secured with measures within this document.</t>

          <t>Hybrid mode: For all supported modes, both secure and insecure
          communication modes can be used at the same time, for both NTP
          servers and clients.</t>

          <t>Compatibility:<list style="symbols">
              <t>NTS-secured communication does not affect NTP associations
              which are not secured by NTS.</t>

              <t>NTS-secured authentication requests do not affect any NTP
              servers that do not support NTS.</t>

    <section title="Overview of NTS-Secured NTP">
      <t>The Network Time Protocol includes many different operating modes to
      support various network topologies. In addition to its best-known and
      most-widely-used client-server mode, it also includes modes for
      synchronization between symmetric peers, a control mode for server
      monitoring and administration and a broadcast mode. These various modes
      have differing and contradictory requirements for security and
      performance. Symmetric and control modes demand mutual authentication
      and mutual replay protection, and for certain message types control mode
      may require confidentiality as well as authentication. Client-server
      mode places more stringent requirements on resource utilization than
      other modes, because servers may have vast number of clients and be
      unable to afford to maintain per-client state. However, client-server
      mode also has more relaxed security needs, because only the client
      requires replay protection: it is harmless for servers to process
      replayed packets. The security demands of symmetric and control modes,
      on the other hand, are in conflict with the resource-utilization demands
      of client-server mode: any scheme which provides replay protection
      inherently involves maintaining some state to keep track of what
      messages have already been seen.</t>

      <t>This document does not discuss how to add security to NTP's broadcast
      mode.</t>

      <section anchor="overview" title="Client-Server Mode">
        <t>The server does not keep a long-term state of the client. NTS
        initially verifies the authenticity of the time server and exchanges
        one or more symmetric keys. The DTLS-based key exchange procedure
        described in <xref target="key-exchange"/> can be used for this
        exchange. An implementation MUST support the use of this procedure. It
        MAY additionally support the use of any alternative secure
        communication for this purpose, as long as it fulfills the
        preconditions given in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ntp-network-time-security"/>, Section 6.1.1.</t>

        <t>After the keys have been exchanged, the participants then use them
        to protect the authenticity and the integrity of subsequent
        unicast-type time synchronization packets. In order to do this, the
        server attaches a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to each time
        synchronization packet. The calculation of the MAC includes the whole
        time synchronization packet and the symmetric key which is stored on
        the client side. Therefore, the client can perform a validity check
        for this MAC on reception of a time synchronization packet.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Symmetric/Peer Mode and Control Modes">
        <t>In the symmetric ("peer") mode as well as in control modes, there
        is no requirement for statelessness on either side. Both sides
        exchange and memorize one or more shared secrets. The shared secrets
        exchanged are then used to secure NTP peer mode or control packets by
        providing at least authenticity and integrity protection and possibly
        also confidentiality. The DTLS-based key exchange procedure described
        in <xref target="dtls-encapsulation"/> can be used for such
        communication. An implementation MUST support the use of this
        procedure.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="key-exchange" title="Employing DTLS for NTP Security">
      <t>Since (as discussed in <xref target="overview"/>) no single approach
      can simultaneously satisfy the needs of all modes, this specification
      consists of not one protocol but a suite of them: <list style="symbols">
          <t>The "NTS-encapsulated NTPv4" protocol is little more than "NTP
          over DTLS": the two endpoints perform a DTLS handshake and then
          exchange NTP packets encapsulated as DTLS Application Data. It is
          suitable for symmetric and control modes, and is also secure for
          client/server mode but relatively wasteful of server resources.</t>

          <t>The "NTS Key Establishment" protocol (NTS-KE) uses DTLS to
          establish key material and negotiate some additional protocol
          options, but then quickly closes the DTLS channel and does not use
          it for the exchange of time packets. NTS-KE is designed to be
          extensible, and might be extended to support key establishment for
          other protocols such as PTP.</t>

          <t>The "NTS extensions for NTPv4" are a collection of NTP extension
          fields for cryptographically securing NTPv4 using key material
          previously negotiated using NTS-KE. They are suitable for securing
          client/server mode because the server can implement them without
          retaining per-client state, but on the other hand are suitable
          *only* for client/server mode because only the client, and not the
          server, is protected from replay.</t>
        </list></t>

      <section anchor="dtls-profile"
               title="DTLS profile for Network Time Security">
        <t>Since securing time protocols is (as of 2016) a novel application
        of DTLS, no backward-compatibility concerns exist to justify using
        obsolete, insecure, or otherwise broken DTLS features or versions. We
        therefore put forward the following requirements and guidelines,
        roughly representing 2016's best practices.</t>

        <t>Implementations MUST NOT negotiate DTLS versions earlier than
        1.2.</t>

        <t>Implementations willing to negotiate more than one possible version
        of DTLS SHOULD NOT respond to handshake failures by retrying with a
        downgraded protocol version. If they do, they MUST implement <xref
        target="RFC7507"/>.</t>

        <t>DTLS clients MUST NOT offer, and DTLS servers MUST not select, RC4
        cipher suites. <xref target="RFC7465"/></t>

        <t>DTLS clients SHOULD offer, and DTLS servers SHOULD accept, the
        <xref target="RFC5746">TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension</xref>.
        Regardless, they MUST NOT initiate or permit insecure renegotiation.
        (*)</t>

        <t>DTLS clients SHOULD offer, and DTLS servers SHOULD accept, the
        <xref target="RFC7627">TLS Session Hash and Extended Master Secret
        Extension</xref>. (*)</t>

        <t>Use of the <xref target="RFC7301">Application-Layer Protocol
        Negotiation Extension</xref> is integral to NTS and support for it is
        REQUIRED for interoperability.</t>

        <t>(*): Note that DTLS 1.3 or beyond may render the indicated
        recommendations inapplicable.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="transport-mechanisms"
               title="Transport mechanisms for DTLS records">
        <t>This section specifies two mechanisms, one REQUIRED and one
        OPTIONAL, for exchanging NTS-related DTLS records. It is intended that
        the choice of transport mechanism be orthogonal to any concerns at the
        application layer: DTLS records SHOULD receive identical disposition
        regardless of which mechanism they arrive by.</t>

        <section title="Transport via NTS port">
          <t>In this transport mechanism, DTLS records, formatted according to
          <xref target="RFC6347">RFC 6347</xref> or a subsequent revision
          thereof, are exchanged directly on UDP port [[TBD]], with one DTLS
          record per UDP packet and no additional layer of encapsulation
          between the UDP header and the DTLS record. Servers which implement
          NTS MUST support this mechanism.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Transport via NTP extension field">
          <t>In this transport mechanism, DTLS records are exchanged within
          extension fields of specially-formed NTP packets, which are
          themselves exchanged via the usual NTP service port (123/udp). NTP
          packets conveying DTLS records SHALL be formatted as in <xref
          target="dtls-packet-layout"/>. They MUST NOT contain any other
          extensions or a legacy MAC field.</t>

          synchronization. To NTS-aware implementations, however, these
          packets are best understood as not being NTP packets at all, but
          simply a means of "smuggling" arbitrary DTLS records across port
          123/udp. Indeed, these records need not be pertinent to NTP at all
          &mdash; for example, they could be NTS-KE messages eventually
          intended for securing PTP traffic.</t>

          <t>This transport mechanism is intended for use as a fallback in
          situations where firewalls or other middleboxes are preventing
          communication on the NTS port. Support for it is OPTIONAL.</t>

        <t>The NTS-encapsulated NTPv4 protocol proceeds in two parts. First,
        DTLS handshake records are exchanged using one of the two transport
        mechanisms specified in <xref target="transport-mechanisms"/>. The two
        endpoints carry out a DTLS handshake in conformance with <xref
        target="dtls-profile"/>, with the client offering (via an <xref
        target="RFC7301">ALPN</xref> extension), and the server accepting, an
        application-layer protocol of "ntp/4". Second, once the handshake is
        successfully completed, the two endpoints use the established channel
        to exchange arbitrary NTPv4 packets as DTLS-protected Application
        Data.</t>

        <t>In addition to the requirements specified in <xref
        target="dtls-profile"/>, implementations MUST enforce the anti-replay
        mechanism specified in <xref target="RFC6347"> Section 4.1.2.6 of RFC
        6347</xref> (or an equivalent mechanism specified in a subsequent
        revision of DTLS). Servers wishing to enforce access control SHOULD
        either demand a client certificate or use a PSK-based handshake in
        order to establish the client's identity.</t>

        <t>The NTS-encapsulated NTPv4 protocol is the RECOMMENDED mechanism
        for cryptographically securing mode 1 (symmetric active), 2 (symmetric
        passive), and 6 (control) NTPv4 traffic. It is equally safe for mode
        3/4 (client/server) traffic, but is NOT RECOMMENDED for this purpose
        because it scales poorly compared to using <xref

              We've seen <xref target="RFC7821">Checksum Complement</xref> and

          string as was provided in the client packet to which the server is

          <t>The Unique Identifier extension provides the client with a
          cryptographically strong means of detecting replayed packets. It may
          also be used standalone, without NTS, in which case it provides the
          client with a means of detecting spoofed packets from off-path
          attackers. Historically, NTP's origin timestamp field has played
          both these roles, but for cryptographic purposes this is suboptimal
          because it is only 64 bits long and, depending on implementation
          details, most of those bits may be predictable. In contrast, the
          Unique Identifier extension enables a degree of unpredictability and
          collision-resistance more consistent with cryptographic best
          practice.</t>

          amplification). The contents of the NTS Cookie Placeholder
          extension's body are undefined and, aside from checking its length,
          MUST be ignored by the server.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="The NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extensions extension">
          <t>The NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extensions extension is the
          central cryptographic element of an NTS-protected NTP packet. Its
          Field Type is [[TBD]] and the format of its body SHALL be as
          follows: <list>
              <t>Nonce length: two octets in network byte order, giving the
              length of the Nonce field.</t>

              <t>Nonce: a nonce as required by the negotiated AEAD
              Algorithm.</t>

              <t>Ciphertext: the output of the negotiated AEAD Algorithm. The
              structure of this field is determined by the negotiated
              algorithm, but it typically contains an authentication tag in
              addition to the actual ciphertext.</t>

              <t>Padding: between 1 and 24 octets of padding, with every octet
              set to the number of padding octets included, e.g., "01", "02
              02", or "03 03 03". The number of padding bytes should be chosen
              in order to comply with the <xref target="RFC7822">RFC
              7822</xref> requirement that (in the absence of a legacy MAC)
              extensions have a total length in octets (including the four
              octets for the type and length fields) which is at least 28 and
              divisible by 4. At least one octet of padding MUST be included,
              so that implementations can unambiguously delimit the end of the
              ciphertext from the start of the padding.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The Ciphertext field SHALL be formed by providing the following
          inputs to the negotiated AEAD Algorithm: <list>
              <t>K: For packets sent from the client to the server, the C2S
              key SHALL be used. For packets sent from the server to the
              client, the S2C key SHALL be used.</t>

              <t>A: The associated data SHALL consist of the portion of the
              NTP packet beginning from the start of the NTP header and ending
              at the end of the last extension which precedes the NTS
              Authenticator and Encrypted Extensions extension.</t>

              <t>P: The plaintext SHALL consist of all (if any) extensions to
              be encrypted.</t>

              <t>N: The nonce SHALL be formed however required by the
              negotiated AEAD Algorithm.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extensions extension MUST NOT
          be included in NTP packets whose mode is other than 3 (client) or 4
          (server).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Protocol details">
          <t>A client sending an NTS-protected request SHALL include the
          following extensions: <list>
              <t>Exactly one Unique Identifier extension, which MUST be
              authenticated and MUST NOT be encrypted [[Ed. Note: so that if
              the server can't decrypt the request, it can still echo back the
              Unique Identifier in the NTS NAK it sends]]. MUST NOT duplicate
              those of any previous request.</t>

              <t>Exactly one NTS Cookie extension, which MUST be authenticated
              and MUST NOT be encrypted. The cookie MUST be one which the
              server previously provided the client; it may have been provided
              during the NTS-KE handshake or in response to a previous
              NTS-protected NTP request. To protect client's privacy, the same
              cookie SHOULD NOT be included in multiple requests. If the
              client does not have any cookies that it has not already sent,
              it SHOULD re-run the NTS-KE protocol before continuing.</t>

              <t>Exactly one NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extensions
              extension, generated using an AEAD Algorithm and C2S key
              established through NTS-KE.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The client MAY include one or more NTS Cookie Placeholder
          extensions, which MUST be authenticated and MAY be encrypted. The
          number of NTS Cookie Placeholder extensions that the client includes
          SHOULD be such that if the client includes N placeholders and the
          server sends back N+1 cookies, the number of unused cookies stored
          by the client will come to eight. When both the client and server
          adhere to all cookie-management guidance provided in this memo, the
          number of placeholder extensions will equal the number of dropped
          packets since the last successful volley.</t>

          <t>The client MAY include additional (non-NTS-related) extensions,
          which MAY appear prior to the NTS Authenticator and Encrypted
          Extensions extension (therefore authenticated but not encrypted),
          within it (therefore encrypted and authenticated), or after it
          (therefore neither encrypted nor authenticated). In general,
          however, the server MUST discard any unauthenticated extensions and
          process the packet as though they were not present. Servers MAY
          implement exceptions to this requirement for particular extensions
          if their specification explicitly provides for such.</t>

          <t>Upon receiving an NTS-protected request, the server SHALL
          (through some implementation-defined mechanism) use the cookie to
          recover the AEAD Algorithm, C2S key, and S2C key associated with the
          request, and then use the C2S key to authenticate the packet and
          decrypt the ciphertext. If the cookie is valid and authentication
          and decryption succeed, then the server SHALL include the following
          extensions in its response: <list>
              <t>Exactly one Unique Identifier extension, which MUST be
              authenticated, MUST NOT be encrypted, and whose contents SHALL
              echo those provided by the client.</t>

              <t>Exactly one NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extensions
              extension, generated using the AEAD algorithm and S2C key
              recovered from the cookie provided by the client.</t>

              <t>One or more NTS Cookie extensions, which MUST be
              authenticated and encrypted. The number of NTS Cookie extensions
              included SHOULD be equal to, and MUST NOT exceed, one plus the
              number of valid NTS Cookie Placeholder extensions included in
              the request.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The server MAY include additional (non-NTS-related) extensions,
          which MAY appear prior to the NTS Authenticator and Encrypted
          Extensions extension (therefore authenticated but not encrypted),
          within it (therefore encrypted and authenticated), or after it
          (therefore neither encrypted nor authenticated). In general,
          however, the client MUST discard any unauthenticated extensions and
          process the packet as though they were not present. Clients MAY
          implement exceptions to this requirement for particular extensions
          if their specification explicitly provides for such.</t>

          <t>If the server is unable to validate the cookie or authenticate
          the request, it SHOULD respond with a Kiss-o'-Death packet (see
          <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905, Section 7.4)</xref>) with kiss code
          "NTSN" (meaning "NTS NAK"). Such a response MUST include exactly one
          Unique Identifier extension whose contents SHALL echo those provided
          by the client. It MUST NOT include any NTS Cookie or NTS
          Authenticator and Encrypted Extensions extension. [[Ed. Note: RFC
          5905 already provides the kiss code "CRYP" meaning "Cryptographic
          authentication or identification failed" but I think this is meant
          to be Autokey-specific.]]</t>

          <t>Upon receiving an NTS-protected response, the client MUST verify
          that the Unique Identifier matches that of an outstanding request,
          and that the packet is authentic under the S2C key associated with
          that request. If either of these checks fails, the packet MUST be
          discarded without further processing.</t>

          <t>Upon receiving an NTS NAK, the client MUST verify that the Unique
          Identifier matches that of an outstanding request. If this check
          fails, the packet MUST be discarded without further processing. If
          this check passes, the client SHOULD discard all cookies and AEAD
          keys associated with the server which sent the NAK and initiate a
          fresh NTS-KE handshake.</t>

      <section anchor="recommended-format-for-nts-cookies"
               title="Recommended format for NTS cookies">
        <t>This section provides a RECOMMENDED way for servers to construct
        NTS cookies. Clients MUST NOT examine the cookie under the assumption
        that it is constructed according to this section.</t>

        <t>The role of cookies in NTS is closely analagous to that of session
        cookies in TLS. Accordingly, the thematic resemblance of this section
        to <xref target="RFC5077">RFC 5077</xref> is deliberate, and the
        reader should likewise take heed of its security considerations.</t>

        <t>Servers should select an AEAD algorithm which they will use to
        encrypt and authenticate cookies. The chosen algorithm should be one
        such as <xref target="RFC5297">AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256</xref> which
        resists accidential nonce reuse, and it need not be the same as the
        one that was negotiated with the client. Servers should randomly
        generate and store a master AEAD key `K`. Servers should additionally
        choose a non-secret, unique value `I` as key-identifier for `K`.</t>

        <t>Servers should periodically (e.g., once daily) generate a new pair
        (I,K) and immediately switch to using these values for all
        newly-generated cookies. Immediately following each such key rotation,
        servers should securely erase any keys generated two or more rotation
        periods prior. Servers should continue to accept any cookie generated
        using keys that they have not yet erased, even if those keys are no
        longer current. Erasing old keys provides for forward secrecy,
        limiting the scope of what old information can be stolen if a master
        key is somehow compromised. Holding on to a limited number of old keys
        allows clients to seamlessly transition from one generation to the
        next without having to perform a new NTS-KE handshake.</t>

        <t>[[TODO: discuss key management considerations for load-balanced
        servers]]</t>

        <t>To form a cookie, servers should first form a plaintext `P`
        consisting of the following fields: <list>
            <t>The AEAD algorithm negotiated during NTS-KE</t>

            <t>The S2C key</t>

            <t>The C2S key</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Servers should the generate a nonce `N` uniformly at random, and
        form AEAD output `C` by encrypting `P` under key `K` with nonce `N`
        and no associated data.</t>

        <t>The cookie should consist of the tuple `(I,N,C)`.</t>

        just how to form one]]</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>All security considerations described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ntp-network-time-security"/> have to be taken into
      account. The application of NTS to NTP requires the following additional
      considerations.</t>

      <section title="Random Number Generation">
        <t>At various points of the protocol, the generation of random numbers
        is required. The employed methods of generation need to be
        cryptographically secure. See <xref target="RFC4086"/> for guidelines
        concerning this topic.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Usage of NTP Pools">
        <t>The certification-based authentication scheme described in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ntp-network-time-security"/> is not applicable to the
        concept of NTP pools. Therefore, NTS is unable to provide secure usage
        of NTP pools.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Initial Verification of the Server Certificates">
        <t>The client may wish to verify the validity of certificates during
        the initial association phase. Since it generally has no reliable time
        during this initial communication phase, it is impossible to verify
        the period of validity of the certificates.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Treatment of Initial Messages">
        <t>NTP packets which contains extension fields with key exchange
        messages do not provide integrity and authenticity protection of the
        included time stamps. Therefore these NTP packets MUST NOT be used for
        clock synchronization. Otherwise an initial attack on the client's
        clock <xref target="attacking-ntp"/> can potentially circumvent the
        employed security measures of later messages <xref
        target="delorean"/>.</t>

      <section title="DTLS-Related Issues">
        <t>... TBD</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="DelayAttack" title="Delay Attack">
        <t>In a packet delay attack, an adversary with the ability to act as a
        MITM delays time synchronization packets between client and server
        asymmetrically <xref target="RFC7384"/>. This prevents the client from
        accurately measuring the network delay, and hence its time offset to
        the server <xref target="Mizrahi"/>. The delay attack does not modify
        the content of the exchanged synchronization packets. Therefore,
        cryptographic means do not provide a feasible way to mitigate this
        attack. However, the maximum error that an adversary can introduced is
        bounded by half of the round trip delay. Also, several
        non-cryptographic precautions can be taken in order to detect this
        attack.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Usage of multiple time servers: this enables the client to
            detect the attack, provided that the adversary is unable to delay
            the synchronization packets between the majority of servers. This
            approach is commonly used in NTP to exclude incorrect time servers
            <xref target="RFC5905"/>.</t>

            <t>Multiple communication paths: The client and server utilize
            different paths for packet exchange as described in the I-D <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-tictoc-multi-path-synchronization"/>. The client
            can detect the attack, provided that the adversary is unable to
            manipulate the majority of the available paths <xref
            target="Shpiner"/>. Note that this approach is not yet available,
            neither for NTP nor for PTP.</t>

            <t>Usage of an encrypted connection: the client exchanges all
            packets with the time server over an encrypted connection (e.g.
            IPsec). This measure does not mitigate the delay attack, but it
            makes it more difficult for the adversary to identify the time
            synchronization packets.</t>

            <t>Introduction of a threshold value for the delay time of the
            synchronization packets. The client can discard a time server if
            the packet delay time of this time server is larger than the
            threshold value.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
      <section title="Confidentiality">
        <t>The actual time synchronization data in NTP packets does not
        involve any information that needs to be kept secret. There also does
        not seem to be any necessity to disguise the nature of an NTP
        association. This is why content confidentiality is a non-objective
        for this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Unlinkability">
        <t>The scenario that is to be prevented is one where whenever a new
        network address is associated with a device (e.g. because said device
        moved between different networks), a passive attacker is able to link
        said new address with one that was formerly used by the device,
        because of recognizable data that the device persistently sends as
        part of an NTS-secured NTP association. This is the justification for
        continually supplying the client with fresh cookies, so that a cookie
        never represents recognizable data in the sense outlined above.</t>

        <t>Note that the objective of NTS regarding unlinkability is merely to
        not leak any additional data that would cause linkability. NTS does
        not rectify legacy linkability issues that are already present in NTP.
        To minimize the risk of being tracked by a passive adversary the NTP
        client has to minimize the information it transmits within a client
        request (mode 3 packet) as described in the draft <xref
        target="I-D.draft-dfranke-ntp-data-minimization"/>.</t>

        <t>Also note that generally, NTP clients should not unnecessarily act
        as NTP servers. Otherwise, an active adversary may be able to abuse
        the client's server responses for its tracking. In the case where the
        participant in question offers services as an NTS-secured NTP server,
        an active adversary can identify it via the received certificate from
        a key exchange for NTS-secured NTP. But even in the case where this is
        not possible, an active adversary can use mode 4 packets for tracking
        the device in question, by evaluating combinations of the given fields
        Precision, Root Delay, Root Dispersion, Reference ID, and Reference
        Timestamp.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>A protocol is provided in this standard that enables precise
            synchronization of clocks in measurement and control systems
            implemented with technologies such as network communication, local
            computing, and distributed objects. The protocol is applicable to
            systems communicating via packet networks. Heterogeneous systems
            are enabled that include clocks of various inherent precision,
            resolution, and stability to synchronize. System-wide
            synchronization accuracy and precision in the sub-microsecond
            range are supported with minimal network and local clock computing
            resources. Simple systems are installed and operated without
            requiring the management attention of users because the default
            behavior of the protocol allows for it.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>For the last few years, some different attacks against SSL/TLS
            have been released. Some of them based on cryptography or protocol
            weaknesses such as BEAST, CRIME, BREACH, etc, and some others,
            such as SSLStrip, based on rewriting HTTPS links into HTTP ones
            and keep user communications always in HTTP. In order to protect
            users against SSLStrip attacks, a new protection called HTTP
            Strict Transport Security (HSTS) has been developed and it&rsquo;s
            currently supported by most widely used browsers. However, under
            certain circumstances, an attacker could exploit an
            inter-operation vulnerability in order to bypass HTTP Strict
            Transport Security protection and use other well-known attack
            techniques such as SSLStrip. In this paper, we review the HSTS
            strengths and weaknesses, and we go in-depth on this
            inter-operation vulnerability and how it could be exploited.</t>
